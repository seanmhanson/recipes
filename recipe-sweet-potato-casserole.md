# Sweet Potato Casserole

## Ingredients 

### Filling

-  **4 cups sweet potatoes**
-  **2 eggs**, beaten
-  **1 cup white sugar**
-  **1/2 cup butter**, room temperature
-  **1 tsp vanilla extract**
-  **1/4 tsp cinnamon**

### Topping

-  **1/2 cup flour**
-  **1/2 cup butter** room temperature
  - _note_: if the butter is at all cool, the topping will not combine
-  **1 1/2 cup brown sugar**
-  **1 1/2 cup pecan pieces**, crushed

## Recipe

### Roasted Sweet Potatoes

Preheat oven to **400°F**.

Wash sweet potatoes well, then piece each thoroughly with a fork and place on a baking tray lined with alumnimum foil. Bake for 60-90min. 

Submerge in cold water and let cool (or in a refrigerator overnight).

### Casserole

Preheat the oven to **350°F**.

Remove the skins of the sweet potatoes and cut into large chunks, then mash. Add the eggs, butter, sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon, and mix until well integrated, mostly without lumps.

In a separate bowl, combine the flour, butter, brown sugar, and crushed pecans. Mix thoroughly, adding additional butter if needed to bind the ingredients.

In a greased or buttered casserole dish (ex: 9" by 9"), spread the sweet potato filling and cover with the pecan topping. Bake for 30minutes, uncovered. Remove, let cool, and serve. Alternatively, make in advance and refrigerate up to three days.

## Recipe

### Preparation

Remove the skin from the pork shoulder, and remove excess fat. Rub down with salt and pepper. In general, the more fat you opt to keep, the more you should slightly decrease the amount of added liquid ingredients.

Coat the slow cooker with neutral oil, and add the pork shoulder, apple cider vinegar, broth, and barbecue sauce. Stir to mix, and then spoon over the pork shoulder until well coated.

Add the brown sugar, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, chili powder, bayleaves, and thyme, and stir and spoon over the pork as before.

### Slow Cooking (Low Setting)
If cooking on a low setting, cook for 8-10 hours, seasoning with the remaining  ingredients approximately halfway through. 

### Slow Cooking (High Setting)
If cooking on a high setting, cook for 2 hours, then season with the remaining ingredients, and set for 4-5hrs on the low setting.

### Serving

Once cooked and on the keep warm setting, remove the bones of the pork shoulder, then use tongs to shred the pork and mix thoroughly into the barbecue. If desired, drain excess liquid, and/or skim fat off the top of the dish.

Serve with a slotted spoon on hamburger buns if eating immediately, or set in a refrigerator overnight before serving. If you intend to freeze a portion of the barbecue, do not portion out to freeze until after refrigerating overnight.

## Recipe

### Chicken and Stock
In a large pot, add the two quarts water, quartered chicken, salt, and aromatics.  
Bring to a boil, then reduce to medium-low heat and simmer for roughly 45min, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is fully cooked and tender, then remove the chicken and set aside.

**Note**: depending on the chicken, foam/fat may accumulate on the surface of the broth, and can be easily skimmed and disposed of as desired.

### Bumbu (paste)
**Note**: the paste we make here is used for flavoring the broth, but is ultimately discarded. As a result, don't feel too worried about obtaining a perfectly smooth paste. If anything, preparing by hand without a food processor allows crushing of the ingredients, which intensifies their flavor and scent, and imperfections are welcomed.

**Mortar & Pestle (Cobek dan Ulekan) Method**

Using a mortar and pestle, first add the black peppercorns, coriander, cumin, and anise seeds, crushed daun salam, kaffir leaves and cinnamon, and chilis. Grind, breaking up the peppercorns and seeds, into as fine of a mixture as possible (you'll end up with some pieces of cinnamon and daun salam likely, that's fine). Set aside.

Working in batches, depending on the size of your mortar and pestle, crush and grind the minced shallots, garlic, ginger, galangal and tumeric. When I first mince these ingredients, I tend to put them in a bowl and mix them a bit as I go, so that when I crush them the flavors combine. You won't be able to get this fine enough to be a true paste, but you should be able to reduce the volume and increase the pungency.

**Food Processor Method**

If using a food processor, you can simple chop the minced ingredients, and combine with the dry spices directly and pulse until relatively smooth. Depending on consistency, you may wish to add 1-2 tablespoons of lime juice or water. Set aside, and consider this a gentle reminder to wash your food processor immediately after use, since the tumeric will stain.

**Cooking the Paste**

In a small to medium frying pan on medium heat, liberally add a neutral oil (or peanut oil) to coat the pan. First add the lemongrass and kaffir leaves, then the spice mixture, and saute for a minute or two until fragrant. Add the paste, stirring off and on for 10min, until fragrant and somewhat broken down. Too high heat will burn the paste, and too low heat will reduce the intensity while retaining sweetness, so aim for a medium to medium-low temperature. If I use a mortar and pestle, I will use a large sturdy rubber spatula to crush and press the paste into the sides of the pan as I stir.

### Final Steps
**Thin Rice/Bean Noodles**

Prepare the rice or mung bean noodles according to the package. I soak mine in room-temperature water for 10min and then strain and toss gently with oil and set aside. If the stock seems to have reduced too much, reserve 1-2 cups of the water to add to the stock.

**Chicken**

Once warm or cool to the touch, remove all bones from the chicken and coarsely dice and then shred the meat.

Strain the paste, discarding aromatics and oil, and then add to the stock prepared previously (as well as any reserve water, as needed). Increase the heat to high to establish a boil, then reduce to medium heat and stir off and on for 10-15min. 

Strain the aromatics and paste from the stock, and then return the stock to the pot. Add the chicken, rice noodles, chopped pak choi / bok choy / greens, and bean sprouts. Taste and season with lime juice, salt, etc. to taste.

### Serving
Serve immediately, garnished as desired. The options for garnishing are broad, and can include:
- **lime wedges**, quartered
- **thai basil**, crushed
  - _substitute:_ mint, celery leaf, cilantro
- **fried shallots** or **fried garlic** (available in most Asian markets)
- **half soft-boiled egg** or **poached egg**
- **white rice**, steamed, on the side or added to the bowl before serving the soup
- **sambal**

## Ingredients
### Congee & Base
- **1 cup jasmine rice**
- **1in ginger**, peeled and thinly sliced
- **3 cloves garlic**, crushed and coarsely chopped
- **1 banana or 2 Thai shallots**, halved and thinly sliced
- **4 shiitake mushrooms**, stems removed, thinly sliced
- **1.5lbs chicken thighs**, bone-in
- **6 cups water**

### Aromatics
- **1 stalk lemongrass**, bruised and knotted
- **2-3 whole cloves**
- **1 star anise**
- **1 stick cassia cinnamon**
- **2 bay leaves**
- **2 kaffir leaves**
  -_substitute_: zest of 1/2 a lime
- **1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg**
- **1 1/2 tsp salt**

### Finishing
- **8oz coconut cream**
- **salt** to taste
- **ground white pepper and/or coriander seed** to taste

### Garnishes (optional)
- **spring onion**, thinly sliced diagonally

## Recipe

### Preparation

Add the cup of rice to the instant pot, followed by a layer of the ginger, shallots, garlic, and shiitakes.

Remove skin from the chicken and cut into bite-size pieces, then add to the pot along with the meat attached to the bones.

Add the aromatics: cloves, cinnamon, star anise, bay leaves, kaffir leaves (or lime zest), fresh grated nutmeg, and salt. 

### Pressure Cooking

Top off with 6 cups water, and seal the instant pot. Do not substitute or add coconut milk and/or cream, as the fats from it will break during cooking and ruin the congee.

Cook using the porridge setting (typically 20min cook time and 30min depressurizing). **Do not release pressure manually**, because the excess hot liquid can splatter.

### Finishing
Using tongs, retrieve the chicken pieces that haven't broken down, and then remove and discard any visible aromatics.

Tear the chicken into pieces and remove the bones before adding the meat back to the pot. Pour in 8oz coconut cream and stir thoroughly, then cool, stirring often, for 10min using the saute setting. 

Turn off the instant pot, adjust seasoning to taste, and then serve and garnish as desired.

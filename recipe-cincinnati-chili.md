Adapted from:
- Skyline Chili Copycat, [Food.com](http://www.food.com/recipe/skylike-chili-skyline-chili-copycat-110548)

## Ingredients
- **2 lbs 80/20 lean ground beef**
- **2 yellow or vidalia onions**, finely chopped
- **32oz beef stock**
- **2 (8oz) cans tomato sauce**
- **1 (19oz) can red kidney beans**, drained
- **4-5 cloves garlic**, minced

### Spices (dried)
- **2 1/2 Tbs chili powder**
- **2 Tbs apple cider vinegar**
- **2 tsp Worcestershire sauce**
- **1 oz dark or unsweetened chocolate**, chopped
- **1 tsp cinnamon**, ground
- **1 tsp cumin**, ground
- **1/2 tsp sweet paprika**
- **1/4 tsp allspice, ground**
- **1/4 tsp cloves, ground**
- **3 dried bay leaves**
- **1/2 tsp kosher salt**, plus more to taste
- **1/2 tsp cayenne pepper**, or to taste (optional)
- **1 Tbs dark brown sugar**, or to taste (optional)
  - _note_: use only enough to neutralize acidity, rather than to render sweet

### Garnishes (optional)
- **sharp cheddar cheese**, spiralized or finely shredded
- **onion**, chopped
- **oyster crackers**
- **tabasco or other hot sauce**

## Recipe

Bring the broth to a boil and reduce to a simmer, then add the onion and ground beef and simmer for 10-15min stirring occasionally until most beef does not rise to the surface.

Add remaining ingredients and stir to mix well. Let simmer uncovered for at least one hour, stirring frequently for the first 10 minutes to ensure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pot, then occasionally thereafter.

Periodically check to ensure the chili is reducing. When tasting, the chili will be bland for about the first hour- you should adjust seasonings after this point. Near the end, if the spice is too heavy, one tablespoon sugar or light brown sugar may be added to balance.

Afterward, when the taste is right (up to two additional hours, adding broth as neccessary if you will cook for longer time) remove from heat and remove the bay leaves. Let sit briefly and skim any additional grease or fat from the top before serving.


### Serving

Serve as is, over cooked spaghetti, or over hot dogs in buns, garnishing as desired.

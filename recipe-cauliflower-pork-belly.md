# Chinese Cauliflower and Bacon
Adapted from:
- Cauliflower with Smoked Bacon (腊肉烧花菜), from _The Food of Sichuan_ by Fuchsia Dunlop
- Sautéed Cauliflower with Bacon, as served at [Hao Noodle By Madam Zhu's Kitchen](https://haonoodle.com/), West Village, NYC
- Dry Pot Cauliflower, from [The Woks of Life](https://thewoksoflife.com/dry-pot-cauliflower/) by [Judy Leung](https://thewoksoflife.com/author/jleung/)

I began trying to create a version of this dish after eating at Hao Noodle and having my mind blown by the exact balance of heat, umami, sweetness, and saltiness of such a simple dish. Fuchsia Dunlop's version is beautifully pared down and includes broth, whereas this adaptation is a bit more focused on the spice and heartiness, perhaps at the expense of the produce singing more clearly.

- **1 Banana Shallot / 2 Thai Shallots**, minced finely

### Spices and Seasoning

# Cooking Liquid and/or Broth
- **1 tsp toasted sesame oil**
- **1 Tbs oyster sauce**
- **1/2 cup water or stock**
- **3 Tbs Rice Wine**
- **1 Tbs light soy sauce**
- **1 Tbs Rice Wine Vinegar**
- **1 Tbs palm sugar paste, or dark brown sugar**

## Recipe

### Pork Belly Preparation
Combine the soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, rice wine, rice vinegar, and dash of sugar in a bowl with the diced pork belly and pieces of rind. Mix and let sit to marinade at least 10-15min.

### Spice Preparation (Mortar and Pestle)
First, smash the black cardamom pods; if they are tough, instead cut them into fine slivers and then return them to the mortar and grind them by hand. Add the salt, white, and pink peppercorns and grind well. Repeat with the fennel, cumin, anise, and cinnamon. There is no need to use a spice grinder, as the coarseness of this mix works well with the dish.

### Liquid/Broth Preparation
Mix the sesame oil, oyster sauce, rice wine, light soy sauce, and rice wine vinegar together, then optionally stir in the palm sugar paste or dark brown sugar. Mix well, then add at least 1/2 cup chicken/vegetable stock or water and sit aside.

#### Cooking
Sauteé the garlic in a pan with neutral oil on medium heat until somewhat fragrant, then add the ginger, shallots, bacon, rinds, chili peppers, and lotus root and cook for a few minutes until quite fragrant. Remove the rinds, and add the cauliflower, spice mixture, and prepared liquids, stirring well, and then reduce to medium low and cover for 10min. If there isn't enough liquid, add an additional 1/2 cup of water or stock when reducing the heat.

After simmering, if the liquid is too runny, remove the lid and simmer for 5-10min to allow the liquid to reduce.

When well simmered and the vegetables are softened, add the scallions and mix in the potato starch to thicken slightly. Reduce to low and let simmer an additional 2-3min, then serve over white rice or on its own.

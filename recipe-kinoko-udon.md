## Recipe

### Dashi

Set the dried shiitakes in a bowl of warm water just enough to cover the mushrooms, and place another heavy bowl on top to weigh the mushrooms down. Let sit for 30min.

If you have dried anchovies, slice lengthwise and reconstitute as per the shiitakes above.

Bring the water to a simmer, and then immediately reduce to lowest heat and add the konbu. Let sit for 30min.

After the konbu, shiitakes, and anchovies have soaked, remove the konbu and save for niban dashi (a second, softer flavored dashi useful for miso soup)

Add two handfuls of bonito flakes and bring to a boil. Just before boiling, cut to lowest heat and let sit for 10min.

Strain dashi and return to the pot. Pick out the shiitakes, remove the stems, and return them to the pot, and dispose of the rest. Reduce heat to low.

### Tare

Combine all ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Once started boiling, reduce to a simmer and allow to reduce for 30-40min.

Strain, then adjust to taste with sugar, mirin, or soy sauce.

### Scallions

Add the coarsely chopped scallions to a pan with a small amount of light soy sauce or neutral oil and braise over medium high heat, then set aside.

### Finishing and Serving

Prepare the mushrooms and greens and set aside. If using enoki mushrooms, set aside separately with the greens.

Add the soy sauce and mirin to the broth, and then add the tare to taste (first with 1/2 cup, and then by the ~2 tbs). Bring to a low simmer.

Prepare the udon according to the package, to be served immediately when finished and drained.

At approx. 5 minutes before serving, add the mushrooms to the broth.

At approx. 2 minutes before serving, add the greens and enoki mushrooms, if using.

Once ready, add the noodles to the broth and serve immediately, with braised scallions in each bowl, garnished with diced scallion.
